The formula provided takes into account the number of votes a movie has received ("v") relative to a minimum threshold ("m") set at 104 votes. It also factors in the movie's average rating ("R") and the overall average vote rating across the entire dataset ("C") set at 5.97.

Formula: (v/(v+m) * R) + (m/(m+v) * C )
Write an SQL query to create a new column named "Weighted_avg_rating" based on this formula. Then, we'll retrieve the top 10 movies with the highest weighted average ratings, displaying the movie title ("original_title") and the weighted average rating


Result:

Return the columns original_title, Weighted_avg_rating
Return the output ordered by Weighted_avg_rating in descending order and original_title in ascending order.
